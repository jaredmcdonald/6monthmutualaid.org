### Who receives the money?

We disburse $TK every month to TK recipients and have transferred a total of $TK to people in need. 

Recipients are either referred to the organizing committee or were found seeking assistance online (e.g., on GoFundMe). We prioritize people who have not already received support.

We maintain a small balance of undisbursed funds to cover missed monthly contributions and one-time transfers for unforeseen emergencies. All contributions will ultimately be disbursed to recipients.

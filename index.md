We are a group of people who believe it is deeply unjust that our economic system leaves so many with so little. While capitalism has generated large amounts of wealth, that money overwhelmingly flows to those who need it least: people born into well-off families, those who benefit from systems of racial oppression, people who are able-bodied, etc. Meanwhile, those who don’t benefit from these deeply ingrained systems are often left with little financial support.

As people who benefit from the status quo, we believe that it is our responsibility to repair this injustice. While we cannot easily change our entire economy, we can change how we relate to others within this broader system. Specifically, we can create networks of mutual aid that support people based upon their need—rather than what a bureaucracy has determined they “deserve” or in exchange for a good/service.

It’s our hope that by pledging to give individuals a sum of money each month—an amount they can expect for a period of six months—they’ll be able to focus on making larger structural changes that can benefit them, both now and in the future.

Please consider joining us by [pledging to redistribute some money every month](/how-to-give) to help those who suffer under our current economic system.

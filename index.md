We are a group of people who believe it is deeply unjust that our economic system leaves so many with so little. While capitalism has generated large amounts of wealth, that wealth overwhelmingly flows to those who need it least: people born into wealthy families, people who benefit from systems of racial oppression, people who are able-bodied, people who are naturally gifted, etc.

It is our responsibility as people who benefit from the status quo to repair this injustice. While we cannot easily change our entire economy, we can change how we relate to other people within this broader system. Specifically, we can create systems of mutual aid that support people based upon their need rather than what they are able to do for us. 

It’s our hope that by pledging to give individuals a certain amount each month for 6 months-an amount they can expect for six months–they’ll be able to focus on making larger structural changes that can change their life.

Please consider joining us by [pledging to redistribute some money every month](/how-to-give) to help those who suffer under our current economic system.
